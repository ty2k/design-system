# B.C. Design System version 2

## Who we are

We're the [Online Service Solutions team](https://dir.gov.bc.ca/gtds.cgi?show=Branch&organizationCode=CITZ&organizationalUnitCode=GDX%2dOSS) in the Government Digital Experience Division of the Ministry of Citizens' Services. We are working on a new major version of the B.C. Design System.

## Where the design system has been

Version 1 of the system[^1] consisted of written guidance and HTML and CSS samples, hosted on DevHub. This system was an important first step to unify the look and feel of B.C. government apps and sites. The system was supported (let's face it - not supported!) by a community contribution model.

The system gave a reference look and feel, but it was lacking for both designers and developers.

For designers, the Figma and Adobe XD prototyping libraries were supplied by the community and hosted within a GitHub repo. There was no way for local copies of the files to benefit from centralized updates. All of the design decisions in the system had to be inferred by designers as they created new components they needed.

For developers, the HTML and CSS samples in the component library were a start. But no installable, functional components were included. This caused a lot of work for product teams. Each team had to start by writing their own component library in their preferred framework. Teams contributed community versions of the components they created for their products. But there was no central mechanism for cataloging or supporting these libraries. Unique components added to these libraries never made it back to the central design system. If the original authors of a community library left, it could become a point-in-time artifact.

This was "hard mode". A lot of vibes-based decision making had to happen at the product level once teams looked at the system and saw what it offered.

## Where the design system is going

With the launch of the [new look and feel for gov.bc.ca](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/home) in January, we have a new opportunity to share our designs with version 2 of the B.C. Design System. The new look and feel of gov.bc.ca was the result of [extensive testing and public engagement](https://engage.gov.bc.ca/govtogetherbc/engagement/alpha-gov/).

We want to provide a more functional design system that benefits from the thorough design and testing iteration that went into gov.bc.ca.

For designers, we intend to publish Figma community files that let them use our design tokens and components in their own designs. For developers, we want to publish design tokens and React components for direct use in products.

## What's available now

The first major piece of work for version 2 is our design tokens library. Design tokens represent codified, atomic design decisions.

### Design tokens Figma community file

For designers, our [B.C Design Tokens Figma community file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1326994583954765832) contains style variables and documentation for their use.

## Design tokens npm package

For developers, our [@bcgov/design-tokens npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bcgov/design-tokens) can be installed into your app or component library.

The big idea with design tokens is to improve the designer and developer experience by providing a direct connection in their work. Designers can use the tokens in their Figma designs, with developers able to see which tokens are used where in generated code. Then, developers can use the corresponding design tokens variables in their code. By using these central sources, teams can benefit from updates to the Figma community file or npm package. Teams choose when to update their version of the design tokens.

## What's coming

We're hard at work on component guidance (both in Figma files and a documentation hub) and a React component library. Our goal is to get to a point where teams can use our components directly in both their Figma designs and their React applications.

You can check out an early version of our React component library in our [@bcgov/design-system-react-components npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bcgov/design-system-react-components).

## Can you help?

Can you please donate some designers and developers to our cause? No, seriously. Email <a href="mailto:DesignSystem@gov.bc.ca">DesignSystem@gov.bc.ca</a>, please.
