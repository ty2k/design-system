# Abbreviations and Acronyms
An abbreviation or acronym is a shortened form of a word, phrase, or name. They are often used to reduce redundancy within a body of text.

## Example
<component-preview path="components/abbreviations/sample.html" height="100px" width="800px"> </component-preview>

## Use This For:
* Providing the full name of an abbreviation or acronym

## Design Guidance
* Give the full name and put the abbreviation or acronym in parentheses the first time you use them. For example, Provincial sales tax (PST)
* For more information on using abbreviations and acronyms read the guide on [Writing for the Web] (https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/policies-procedures/web-content-development-guides/writing-for-the-web/web-style-guide/abbreviations)

## Rationale
* Screenreaders and assistive technologies cannot identify how to properly read abbreviations without being warned with proper tagging.
